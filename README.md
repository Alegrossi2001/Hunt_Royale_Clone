# Hunt_Royale_Clone
A simple clone of the game "Hunt Royale", for the attention of Boombit

Dear Mr. Byczynski,

Thank you so much for giving me the opportunity to showcase my coding abilities. Please find the GitHub repository and the case study I have written on my website at the end of this email.

I have created this clone of Hunt Royale in the past week - of course, this is nowhere near as polished and great as the final result, but it will give you an idea of the quality of the code, which I deem acceptable for the industry, but still lacks the experience I hope to get working for Boombit.

What attracts me to this great company is how inspiring Boombit’s values are. On the website,  you talk about growing and adapting - which is exactly what I believe I am at the core - a game developer with a passion for growing and learning new, upcoming technologies.

Although I don’t believe I am as skilled as many of your programmers at Boombit, I believe I can bring my passion for teamwork and creativity to the team. Finally, I ask you if there are any open positions for Junior Developers in your team, or if you’d consider a Junior.

I am happy to work unpaid for the first months to prove myself - I am also happy to carry out any tests or anything to show how committed I am to this exciting new opportunity.

Thank you once again,

Alex Grossi
